**SYSMAL (System Malware Analyzer)** is a web application that allows users to upload executable files (.exe) to be analyzed and predicted whether they contain malware or not.

The analysis process is carried out through framework integration **CAPEv2** to perform dynamic analysis and **model deep learning LSTM** for malware prediction based on extracted data.

This project's model repository can be found at https://github.com/benrazor45/sysmal.git

### ðŸ”§ Key Features:
- Upload `.exe` files directly via the web interface
- Analysis process using CAPEv2 framework
- Prediction using a trained LSTM model
- View analysis status and prediction results in real-time
